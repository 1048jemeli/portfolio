    <h2>ABOUT</h2>
    <p>
        I am very outgoing and curious young woman who has always had the passion to make the world a better and easier environment for all humankind. That being said,
        I figured that there is no better solution than to improve the internet working because work, socialization, marketing and many other day to day 
        human habits are done here. Computer programming is everywhere in our daily lives. Many of the devices we use every day, such as phones and computers
        are controlled by code. 
    </p>
        <h2>SKILLS</h2>
    <P>
        I have a really great experience and knowledge of programming languages like Java, Python and many others. I also have a great knowledge of perfomance testing
         which is integralto ensuring that applications perform optimally
         under varying conditions. The tech industry is highly competitive, and it takes skills and charm to stand out with some 
        non-technical skills. Some of which I qualify to have are:
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li>Communication</li>
            <li>Time management</li>
            <li>Problem solving</li>
            <li>Teamwork</li>
            <li>Empathy</li>
        </ul>
